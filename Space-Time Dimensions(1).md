As proposed by Albert Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity in 1905, that showed space and time are closely linked, so some say that we actually live in a four-dimensional universe with three spatial dimensions and one time dimension, except we can travel only in the spatial dimensions according to our wish.
But what if there was a two-dimensional space existing somewhere, would time exist there too?

Yes there would be an additional time dimension hence making a three-dimensional universe with the third dimension being 'time' in context of two-dimensional observer and 'spatial' in context of higher dimensional observer

"**That means in our universe the forth dimension is 'time' in the context of three-dimensional observer and 'spatial' in context of higher dimensional observer**""

It can be possible that, n-dimensional axis appears to overlap with n-1-dimensional axis in context of n-1-dimensional observer itself. Where the unit scale of both the dimensional axis may vary and there relation can be displayed as:
$$
m_n\;•\;a_nUS=1\,a_n_+_1US
$$
**(Only used to display 2D in context of 1D)**
Where,
 $m_n$ = magnitude of n-dimensional particle (like in the sense of; 2D-Area, 3D-Volume, etc.)
 $a_nUS$ = Unit scale of 'n' dimensional axis
 $a_n_+_1US$ = Unit scale of 'n+1' dimensional axis

Here, the passing of time and change in position are happening along same axis but independent of eachother 

**NOTE: The above statements about the existence of 2D or 1D universes is a hypothetical case provide just to give an idea about lower dimensional observer viewing a higher dimensional world**

#<u>**n-dimensional magnitude (to measure change in position) vs time graph**</u>

Using this graph, we can find the dimension of a particle by observing it's motion 

<img src="storage/emulated/0/Documents/PureWriter/Assets/1000042522_we88.jpg" width="720"></img>
Where, 
 x-axis = n-dimensional axis
 y-axis = (n+1)-dimensional axis
 θ = $cot^-^1($Rate of change of magnitude/position w.r.t time$)$

If:
1) θ = 0°, then the object traveling is (n-1)-dimensional in the frame of reference of n-dimensional observer
2) θ = 0° - 90°, then the object traveling is n-dimensional in the frame of reference of n-dimensional observer
3) θ = 90°, then the object traveling is (n+1)-dimensional in the frame of reference of n-dimensional observer
4) θ = 45°, then the object traveling is perfectly n-dimensional in the frame of reference of n-dimensional observer

This can help us know about the nature of dimensions and the nature of objects,

Photons are the closest particles reaching near to 2D in the frame of reference of 3D observer as $cot^-^1(3•10^8)≈0°$. Similarly, the speed an object inside a blackhole in the frame of reference of 3D observer is approx. 0m/s because of time dilation caused by the strong gravitational field at the centre of blackhole, so here, $cot^-^1(0)≈90°$ that shows that object inside blackhole (to be precise, approximately at its centre) is the closest object reaching near to 4D in the frame of reference of 3D observer, yet them still being in 3D

for the speed to be accurately 0 m/s, that can be possible when an object is at the true singularity of a blackhole (I.e. Schwarzchild blackhole). In this universe, a blackhole with true singularity doesn't exist. But in the scenerio of Big Crush (where the universe will contract in itself) that is predicted to begin when the universe stops expanding, there, such singularity is said to exist but being different from a Schwarzchild blackhole because of lack of event horizon like seen in our traditional black holes, but the primary reason of that could be caused by the absence of space-time frame near the singularity. At the singularity, the masses of all dimensions would exist in the single point, making the singularity having the highest dimension

As the singularity is similar to Schwarzchild blackhole's singularity, we can find the magnitude of space-time curvature of that singularity in the context of a 3D observer using Kretschmann scaler, that would help us to find the dimension of that singularity formed in the Big Crunch;

$$
K = \frac{48 G^2 M^2}{c^4 r^6} 
$$
Where,
( G ) is the gravitational constant.( M ) is the mass of the singularity.( c ) is the speed of light.( r ) is the radial coordinate.
This is a special case that highlights the curvature singularity at ( r = y, where y→0).

As,
$$
\frac{c}{y^x} = \frac{magnitude  'n'}{magnitude  'n-x'}, y →0
$$
(where 'x' is a natural number and 'c' is a constant)

$$
K = \frac{48 G^2 M^2}{c^4 y^6},y→0
$$

$As,\;n-6=3$ (because we are finding the strength of the last dimensional blackhole in 3D context)
$=\;n=9\$
Therefore, the last dimension is 9D.
And to find the the initial arrangement of the dimensions we can substitute 'n' with the preceding dimension and substitute 'x' with 3 (because initial we are in 3rd Dimension) in $\frac{c}{y^x} = \frac{magnitude  'n'}{magnitude  'n-x'}, y →0$
Then the Radial coordinates are calculated to be:
$r^\frac{1}{6}$ for 4D
$r^\frac{2}{6}$ for 5D
$r^\frac{3}{6}$ for 6D
$r^\frac{4}{6}$ for 7D
$r^\frac{5}{6}$ for 8D
$r$ for 9D
where $r→0$

Hence, the arrangement would be:

(The structure of this entire world with all 7 dimensions arranged in layers with the lowest universe being 3D and the highest dimension being 9D)
