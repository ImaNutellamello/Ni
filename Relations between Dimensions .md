Assume a graph. A point on graph (let the coordinates be x,y) assume the distances between the point and x axis ,and between the point and y axis have two points at the end of the distances respectively (x1,0 and 0,y1), and also the origin point 0,0. Let all the points mentioned subtend a rectangle and let their the names of the points be A, B, C and O respectively.
And let's take example where A1 and A2 are two points on the plane like show in the figure

That can also be used to visualise 'Fractions' , as the area of the subtended rectangles, smaller one divided by the bigger one -I.e. 

$$
\frac{A2•B2}{A1•B1}
$$

That can also be:

$$
\frac{x2•y2}{x1•y2}|
 [where A1(x1,y1) and A2(x2,y2)]
$$

In the above figure, the fraction would be equal to '6'.

Let's take another example

<img src="Assets/1000027164_9i2s.jpg" width="720"></img>

In this, with the help of the previous equation we find that:

$$
\frac{Square(A1B1OC1)}{Line(A2B2OC2)}=\frac{1}{0}
$$

This is obvious and makes sense because a Line have no Area. So why plot so many points of graph just to find the fraction?

We observe that if we check the first example graph, we see that the amount of squares (of A1B1OC1) and can fit or can be made into the rectangle present in the same plane (of A2B2OC2) is 6, that equal to the fraction that we found earlier, that obviously means that the fraction tells the amount rect(A1B1OC1) that can fit in rect(A2B2OC2). 

But if we observe the second example, we see that the amount of Lines that can fit in the square is '1/0', we know that infinite many lines (1D) can fit in a square (2D) but that doesn't mean that there is a specific number of lines that can fit in a square because that is only possible is the Line is 2 dimensional with both x and y axis, but that is impossible! As Line is 1 Dimensional. That tells us no matter how many lines are there in a square, it remains a line only and doesn't increase into a 2 dimensional figure.

#So then, What is 1/0??
#We can conclude that, '1/0' is a number that tries to reach a value which it fails to reach as no matter how big or small it gets, it still remain in that same value that it possibly can be. It still tries to reach that value (numerator), Although it is unable to, And cannot satisfy a mathematical equation. 

This value arised when the magnitude of 'n' dimensional figure [Note: 'n' is the number of axis in the particular dimension] is divided by the 'n-1' dimensional figure in the context of the 'n' dimension. That is obvious because if the dimension 'n' contain 3 axis i.e. x,y and z and 'n-1' contain 2 axis i.e. x and y, so in the context of 'n' dimension:

$$
\frac{magnitude 'n'}{magnitude 'n-1'} = \frac{x•y•z}{x•y•z}
$$

And as 'n-1' have only 2 axis that are x and y

<u>**Equation 1**</u>:
$$
\frac{x•y•z}{x•y•z} = \frac{x•y•z}{x•y•0}
$$
$$
= \frac{z}{0}
$$
Here, z is the additional axis with any value ($\frac{z}{0}$ will be always equal to $\frac{1}{0}$, we can verify by plotting the equation: $\frac{z}{x}=\frac{1}{y}$ on Cartesian plane graph)

All this helps us to understand that,
### This is one relationship between a dimension and its preceding dimension, in which the ratio of the magnitude of a specific dimensional figure or object to the magnitude of the preceding dimensional figure or object results in the fraction '1/0' within the context of the dimension being considered, but if the fraction is any value that can be defined, then it would mean that the two figures are present in the same dimension and the ratio is taken within there context.

But what about lower dimensions than 'n-1'?
The ratio of 'n' with 'n-1', 'n-2', 'n-3', etc. are all $\frac{1}{0}$

So, to understand that better we can use the following approach:
$$
\frac{1}{y} = \frac{magnitude  'n'}{magnitude  'n-1'}, y →0
$$
$$
\frac{1}{y•y} = \frac{magnitude  'n'}{magnitude  'n-2'}, y →0
$$
that can be verified using similar concept in "<u>**Equation 1**</u>" used before

Therefore:
$$
\frac{k}{y^x} = \frac{magnitude  'n'}{magnitude  'n-x'}, y →0
$$
(where 'x' is a natural number and 'k' is any constant, because $\frac{k}{0}=\frac{1}{0}$ always)
